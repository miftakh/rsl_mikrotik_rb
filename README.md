SNMP Data Retrieval and Storage Project

This project demonstrates my proficiency in network management and data processing using Python. I utilized various libraries, including PySNMP, Pandas, MySQL Connector, and SQLAlchemy, to design a solution for gathering SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) data from network devices, processing the collected information, and storing it in CSV format.

Key Features:

Employed PySNMP to retrieve SNMP data from network devices, including information like uptime, hostname, IP address, hardware details, serial number, temperature, and optical transceiver power levels.
Developed a function to convert SNMP uptime values from hundredths of seconds to a human-readable format (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
Utilized Pandas DataFrames to organize and manipulate the collected SNMP data efficiently.
Implemented error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle SNMP retrieval failures and record problematic IP addresses.
Stored the processed data in CSV files, enabling easy visualization and analysis.
Calculated and displayed the elapsed time for the entire data collection and processing process.
By successfully completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to work with SNMP protocols, manage data using Pandas, handle exceptions, and interact with relational databases for potential future integration. This project not only showcases my technical skills but also my problem-solving approach and attention to detail in managing network-related data.
